# BMI Calculator for Boston University

As part of my final project at Boston University, I created a BMI calculator to be deployed on the BU health site to calculate BMI. This repository is the executable script that can be downloaded as an 'exe' file.

This project is a great example of a script that was created in development and prepared for production. The code, with proper annotations, explains the full functionality of object oriented programming through classes and inheritance. In addition, I show a useful way to incorporate SQL in order to store a user's personal data.
